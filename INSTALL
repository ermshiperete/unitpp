The unit++ framework is meant to be very simple.

To install it:
  ./configure
  make install

This should take care of everything, and install in /usr/local/{lib,include}.

The all target (make all) will make the test for the test framework, test++.
Try to run it to see that everything is fine. If you want to see a failing
test case, try `test++ -f'.

If you have doc++ available the API interface can be documented by `make
doc'. The DOCDIR variable in the Makefile controls where the files end up.

If you want the documentation without having doc++, I try to keep it update
on the SourceForge page: http://unitpp.sourceforge.net/docs/index.html.
