The unit++ framework is meant to be very simple.

To install it:
  ./configure
  make install

This should take care of everything, and install in /usr/local/{lib,include}.

The all target (make all) will make the test for the test framework, test++.
Try to run it to see that everything is fine. If you want to see a failing
test case, try `test++ -f'.

NOTE:
=====
The tests don't work properly on old C++ compilers, without the <sstream>
header (stringstream classes). That includes the g++ 2.95.3 version found on
SunOS and OpenBSD. However, newer versions of libstd++3 works fine.

This means that some things will not be tested in this case, and some
spurious output will result from running the test++ program. The final count
of tests is correct, even though the output strongly suggests otherwise.
====

Doc.
----
If you have doc++ available the API interface can be documented by `make
doc'. The DOCDIR variable in the Makefile controls where the files end up.

If you want the documentation without having doc++, I try to keep it update
on the SourceForge page: http://unitpp.sourceforge.net/docs/index.html.
