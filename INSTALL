The unit++ framework is meant to be very simple.

To install it simply edit the Makefile to suite your needs with regards to
install target, and C++ compiler. The default is to use g++, and to install
in /usr/local/{lib,include}.

If you have doc++ available the API interface can be documented by `make
doc'. The DOCDIR variable in the Makefile controls where the files end up.

If you want the documentation without having doc++, I try to keep it update
on the SourceForge page: http://unitpp.sourceforge.net/docs/index.html.
